The diffusion equation is relevant in a number of scenarios including thermal diffusion, the diffusion of a chemical in a medium or the spatial distributions of neutrons in a nuclear reactor.\n",

Each element in the domain will then have coordiantes provided in the physical space of that domain. For example, take the triangular element below:\n",

The angles at each vertex and the rotation of the traingle may be different to the canonical triangle.\n",
