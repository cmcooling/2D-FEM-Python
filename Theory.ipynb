    "\n",
    "This code is designed to solve the steady-state diffusion equation in a 2-dimensional domain using the FEM. The diffusion equation is relevant in a number of scenarios including thermal diffusion, the diffusion of a chemical in a medium or the spatial distributions of neutrons in a nuclear reactor.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume the diffusion coefficient $D$ is a constant and so we may write the equation we want to solve as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\nabla^{2}\\phi(\\vec{r}) = S $,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\phi(\\vec{r})$ is the field being solved for (e.g. the temperature of an object, concentration of a chemical of density of neutrons) and $S$ is a source which we will assume is constant over the domain\n",
    "\n",
    "We will further define a zero boundary-condition such that $\\phi = 0$ at the boundary of the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to write a code which will be able to read an input defining a mesh made of triangular and/or quadrilateral elements, receive some values for the diffusion coefficient and the source and then solve the system and output the solution to the equation."
