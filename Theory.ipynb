    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is designed to solve the steady-state diffusion equation in a 2-dimensional domain using the FEM. The diffusion equation is relevant in a number of scenarios including thermal diffusion, the diffusion of a chemical in a medium or the spatial distributions of neutrons in a nuclear reactor.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume the diffusion coefficient $D$ is a constant and so we may write the equation we want to solve as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "$ \\nabla^{2}\\phi(\\vec{r}) = S $,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\phi(\\vec{r})$ is the field being solved for (e.g. the temperature of an object, concentration of a chemical of density of neutrons) and $S$ is a source which we will assume is constant over the domain\n",
    "\n",
    "We will further define a zero boundary-condition such that $\\phi = 0$ at the boundary of the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to write a code which will be able to read an input defining a mesh made of triangular and/or quadrilateral elements, receive some values for the diffusion coefficient and the source and then solve the system and output the solution to the equation."

    "The finite element method breaks the domain up into a number of elements. Each type of element (for example triangle and quadrilateral elements) has several properties defined over a canonical element defined in local coordinates. Each element in the domain will then have coordiantes provided in the physical space of that domain. For example, take the triangular element below:\n",

The angles at each vertex and the rotation of the traingle may be different to the canonical triangle.\n",
